Openlog is a set of assumptions, standards, recommendations for
best practice and offers an example implementation of a protocol
and a web application which makes use of the above for a facility
that enables a user to keep track of personal events over a period
of time in a structured, machine-readable/-exchangeable manner.

This here is only the github readme. The full specs can be found
